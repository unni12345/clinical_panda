3,14889,"The evidences for the diagnosis of HIV (initial infection) from the clinical note include:

1. History of sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive partner within the past 12 months, which is a significant risk factor for HIV transmission.
2. Involuntary weight loss over the last 3 months, which can be a symptom of acute HIV infection.
3. Fever and a pale rash, which are common symptoms associated with the acute retroviral syndrome that occurs in the initial stages of HIV infection.
4. Severe itching and skin issues, which may be related to the immune dysregulation caused by HIV.
5. Diarrhea, which can be a gastrointestinal manifestation of early HIV infection.
6. The patient's history of sexually transmitted infection, which increases the risk of HIV acquisition.

8,56956,"The evidence for the diagnosis of croup in this patient includes:

1. Family history of croup, which may suggest a predisposition to similar respiratory conditions.
2. The characteristic barking cough and stridor, which are common symptoms of croup, especially noted to be more prominent at night.
3. The patient's age (2 years old) is typical for croup, which commonly affects young children.
4. The patient's distress and difficulty breathing, which are consistent with the upper airway obstruction seen in croup.

However, it is important to note that the diagnosis of croup has not been confirmed, and the symptoms overlap with those of whooping cough (pertussis). Further diagnostic testing is needed to differentiate between the two conditions.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, the evidence for the diagnosis of croup in this patient is the presence of a characteristic whooping cough, increased saliva production, and shortness of breath, particularly at night. These symptoms are consistent with the definition of croup, which is an acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract that causes inflammation and narrowing of the larynx and trachea. The narrowing of the airways can lead to difficulty breathing, a characteristic whooping cough, and increased saliva production. The fact that the patient's symptoms are more prominent at night is also consistent with croup, as this is a common feature of the condition. The patient's family history of croup is also relevant, as having a family history of croup can increase the risk of developing the condition. However, it is important to note that other conditions, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess, can also cause symptoms similar to croup, so further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, the evidence for the diagnosis of croup is the presence of a characteristic whooping cough, increased saliva production, and shortness of breath, particularly at night. These symptoms are consistent with the definition of croup, which is an acute viral illness characterized by a barking cough, difficulty breathing, and inspiratory stridor. The patient's family history of croup may also be a contributing factor to the diagnosis. It is important to note that the onset of the symptoms is not specified, but they have been ongoing and severe. The patient has not had any prior treatments for these symptoms, and there is no mention of any other significant conditions such as diabetes or allergies. Overall, the admission note provides sufficient evidence to support the diagnosis of croup in this patient.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that support the diagnosis of croup in this patient.

9,119227,"The evidences for the diagnosis of acute dystonic reactions in this patient include:

1. Difficulty in opening the mouth and jaw pain (symptoms of oromandibular dystonia).
2. Shortness of breath and feeling like suffocating (which can be associated with laryngeal dystonia).
3. Trouble keeping the tongue in the mouth (indicative of lingual dystonia).
4. Difficulty opening/raising one or both eyelids (symptoms of blepharospasm).

These symptoms are consistent with dystonic reactions, which are involuntary muscle contractions affecting one or more muscle groups. The patient's history of regular stimulant drug use is a relevant factor, as certain drugs can induce dystonic reactions.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a diagnosis of acute dystonic reactions. Firstly, the patient is experiencing difficulty in opening her mouth and jaw pain, which are common symptoms of acute dystonic reactions. Secondly, the patient also reports experiencing shortness of breath, feeling like she was suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak, trouble keeping her tongue in her mouth, and difficulty opening/raising one or both eyelids. These symptoms are also commonly associated with acute dystonic reactions. Thirdly, the patient has a history of regular stimulant drug use, which is a known risk factor for acute dystonic reactions. Finally, the patient appears to be in distress due to difficulty in opening her mouth and associated jaw pain, which is also a common manifestation of acute dystonic reactions.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a diagnosis of acute dystonic reactions.

2. Muscle spasms: The patient is experiencing muscle spasms in the face, neck, and other parts of the body.
3. Difficulty with eye movements: The patient has difficulty opening/raising one or both eyelids, which can be a sign of oculogyric crisis, a type of dystonic reaction.
4. Orofacial symptoms: The patient reports trouble keeping the tongue in the mouth and sudden difficulty or inability to open the mouth, which are indicative of orofacial dystonia.
5. No significant past medical history: The absence of other neurological conditions in the patient's history makes a drug-induced reaction more likely.

16,126229,"The evidences for the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis in this patient include:

1. **Nasal congestion and clear runny nose**: Common symptoms of sinusitis.
2. **Facial pain**: Burning pain in the left cheek, nose, eyes, and temples, which is characteristic of sinusitis.
3. **Sudden onset of pain**: Suggests an acute exacerbation, possibly on top of a chronic condition.
4. **Loss of smell (anosmia)**: A hallmark symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis.
5. **Greenish or yellowish nasal discharge**: Indicates the presence of infection and inflammation.
6. **Cough**: Often associated with postnasal drip in sinusitis.
7. **History of a recent cold**: Upper respiratory tract infections can precipitate or exacerbate sinusitis.
8. **Past medical history**: Smoking, nasal polyps, and a deviated septum are risk factors for chronic rhinosinusitis.

The combination of these symptoms, the patient's medical history, and the absence of recent travel (reducing the likelihood of an unusual infection) support the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis.","The diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis is based on the presence of two or more of the following symptoms: nasal blockage or obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain or pressure, hyposmia or anosmia, fever without a known cause, and fatigue. The diagnosis also requires that these symptoms have been present for at least 12 weeks. In addition, objective evidence of nasal congestion or inflammation must be present on nasal endoscopy or computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses.","The diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis is based on the presence of two or more of the following symptoms: nasal blockage or obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain or pressure, hyposmia or anosmia, fever without a known cause, and fatigue.

The patient's history of smoking, pneumonia, nasal polyps, and a deviated nasal septum may increase her risk of developing these conditions. However, the patient's history of a cold two weeks ago suggests that her symptoms may be related to an upper respiratory tract infection rather than allergic rhinitis or sinusitis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is not enough evidence to support a diagnosis of [MASK].

17,44384,"The clinical note does not provide direct evidence of a pancreatic neoplasm; however, there are several indirect indicators that could raise suspicion for this condition:

1. History of chronic pancreatitis: Chronic inflammation of the pancreas can increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
2. Family history of pancreatic cancer: Genetic predisposition can contribute to the risk of pancreatic neoplasms.
3. Symptoms: The patient's sudden onset of epigastric pain, pale stools, and dark urine could be consistent with biliary obstruction, which can be caused by pancreatic tumors.
4. Risk factors: The patient's significant overweight status and smoking history are risk factors for pancreatic cancer.

Further diagnostic imaging (e.g., abdominal ultrasound) and laboratory tests (e.g., liver function tests, pancreatic enzyme levels) are needed to investigate the possibility of a pancreatic neoplasm.","The evidence for the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasm in this case is the patient's history of chronic pancreatitis and a family history of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that can lead to the development of pancreatic cancer. The patient's family history of pancreatic cancer also increases her risk of developing pancreatic neoplasm. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, pale stools, and dark urine are also suggestive of pancreatic neoplasm. However, it is important to note that these symptoms are not specific to pancreatic neoplasm and could be indicative of other conditions as well. Therefore, further diagnostic testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasm.","The evidence for the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasm in this case is the patient's history of epigastric pain, pale stools, and dark urine, as well as her family history of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, the patient's physical examination revealed no rash, lesions, or swelling on the skin. These symptoms and signs are consistent with the presentation of pancreatic neoplasm.

20,129622,"The evidences for the diagnosis of Acute Otitis Media (AOM) in the patient's case include:

1. Symptomatology: The patient presents with a sharp, sensitive ear pain located in the right ear, which is a common symptom of AOM.
2. Associated Symptoms: The presence of a cough, nasal congestion, and a clear runny nose suggests an upper respiratory tract infection, which can be associated with AOM.
3. Current Treatment: The patient is already being treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection, indicating a prior diagnosis of an ear-related issue, likely AOM given the symptoms.
4. Physical Exam: The patient appears to be in discomfort due to ear pain, which supports the presence of an ear condition like AOM.

21,6491,"The evidences for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this patient include:

1. Symptoms of upper respiratory infection: The patient's fever and nasal congestion are common symptoms associated with viral infections of the upper respiratory tract.
2. Pain in the thyroid cartilage: This could indicate throat inflammation, which is a symptom of pharyngitis.
3. Contact with infected individuals: The patient's history of being in contact with a person with similar symptoms increases the likelihood of a contagious viral infection.
4. Coughing up blood: While less common in viral pharyngitis, this could be a result of severe throat irritation or a secondary complication.
5. Absence of significant past medical history: This suggests that the current symptoms are likely due to an acute infection rather than a chronic condition.

The combination of these clinical findings supports the suspicion of viral pharyngitis, although further diagnostic tests, such as a throat swab for rapid antigen detection, might be needed to confirm the viral etiology.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this case is the patient's complaint of coughing up blood, pain in the thyroid cartilage, fever, and nasal congestion. Additionally, the patient has been in contact with a person with similar symptoms, smokes cigarettes, and lives with four or more people. These symptoms are consistent with viral pharyngitis, which typically presents with a sore throat, fever, cough, and nasal congestion. The patient's age, lack of significant past medical history, and lack of current medications or known allergies also support the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis. However, it is important to note that viral pharyngitis can present with a wide range of symptoms, and other conditions such as bacterial pharyngitis or tonsillitis may need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of viral pharyngitis can be made. Based on the information provided in the admission note, it is likely that the patient is experiencing viral pharyngitis, but further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in the given admission note is that the patient has been experiencing symptoms for the past two weeks, including coughing up blood, burning sensation in the nasal cavity, sore throat, and nasal congestion. Additionally, the patient has been in contact with a person with similar symptoms and smokes cigarettes. These symptoms are consistent with viral pharyngitis. However, it is important to note that these symptoms could also be indicative of other conditions such as bacterial pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or streptococcal pharyngitis. Therefore, further testing and evaluation are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this case is the patient's chief complaint of coughing up blood, which is a symptom commonly associated with viral pharyngitis. Additionally, the patient reported a sore throat, fever, and difficulty swallowing, which are also common symptoms of viral pharyngitis. The patient also reported being in contact with a person with similar symptoms, which further supports the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this case is the patient's history of a sore throat for the past two weeks, coughing up blood, pain in the thyroid cartilage, and the fact that the pain does not radiate to another area.

1. Clinical symptoms: The patient presents with an itchy nose and back of the throat, nasal congestion, and a clear runny nose, which are common symptoms of allergic sinusitis.

2. Past medical history: The patient has a history of asthma, which is often associated with allergic sinusitis due to the shared pathophysiology of airway inflammation.

3. Family history: There is a family history of allergies, hay fever, eczema, and asthma, suggesting a genetic predisposition to atopic conditions, including allergic sinusitis.

These clinical findings and history are suggestive of allergic sinusitis, although further testing, such as allergy testing, would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and identify specific allergens.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is not enough evidence to support a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis or allergic rhinosinusitis.

24,33119,"The evidences for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) in this patient include:

1. Chief Complaint (CC): The patient reports symptoms of heart racing and palpitations, which are common presentations of AF.
2. History of Present Illness (HPI): Palpitations and shortness of breath that worsen with exertion and improve with rest could indicate paroxysmal AF.
3. Past Medical History (PMH): The patient has a history of heart valve issues and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for the development of AF.
4. Exacerbating Factors: Physical exertion exacerbating the symptoms is consistent with the exercise intolerance seen in AF.

Further diagnostic tests such as an EKG would be required to confirm the presence of AF by demonstrating an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. An echocardiogram would help assess the structural and functional heart changes associated with AF.","The evidence for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in this case is the patient's report of feeling his heart beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat), and experiencing palpitations.

26,11381,"The evidences for the diagnosis of epiglottitis in this patient include:

1. Voice changes: The patient's deeper, softer, and hoarse voice can be indicative of epiglottis swelling.
2. Pain characteristics: Sharp pain that improves when leaning forward can be associated with epiglottitis, as this position may relieve pressure on the inflamed epiglottis.
3. Pain location: Pain in the tonsils and neck is consistent with the anatomical location of the epiglottis.
4. Sudden onset: Epiglottitis typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms.
5. Fever: The presence of fever suggests an infectious process, which is common in epiglottitis.
6. Increased saliva production: Difficulty swallowing due to a swollen epiglottis can lead to drooling or increased saliva production.

These clinical features support the suspicion of epiglottitis, warranting further investigation such as a throat swab and possibly imaging to confirm the diagnosis.","Epiglottitis is an inflammation of the epiglottis, a structure located at the back of the throat.

2. **Orthopnea**: Symptoms worsening when lying down and improving when sitting up suggest orthopnea, commonly associated with pulmonary edema due to heart failure.

3. **Past Medical History**: The patient has a history of heart-related issues, including fluid in the lungs, heart attack or angina, and heart failure, which predispose her to acute pulmonary edema.

4. **Peripheral Edema**: Swelling in the ankles, calves, and tibia indicates fluid retention, which can be a sign of heart failure leading to pulmonary edema.

5. **Exertional Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath that increases with physical exertion and alleviates with rest is consistent with the exercise intolerance seen in heart failure and pulmonary edema.

6. **Radiating Chest Pain**: While not specific, the pain radiating to areas like the jaw and shoulders can be associated with cardiac issues that may lead to pulmonary edema","The evidence for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema in this case is the patient's report of bouts of choking or shortness of breath that wake her up at night.

29,69124,"The evidences for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this patient include:

1. Symptoms of upper respiratory infection: The patient's nasal congestion and clear runny nose are common symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection.
2. Sore throat without radiation: The patient's sensitive and burning pain in the tonsils, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx, which is intense and localized, is characteristic of pharyngitis.
3. Hemoptysis: Coughing up blood can occur in severe cases of viral pharyngitis due to irritation and inflammation of the throat.
4. Contact with infected individuals: The patient's history of being in contact with someone with similar symptoms and her environment (living with multiple people and working in a daycare) increases the likelihood of a viral infection due to higher exposure risk.
5. Immunocompromised state: The patient's immunosuppression makes her more vulnerable to viral infections, including viral pharyngitis.

Further diagnostic tests, such as a throat swab, would help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial causes.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this case is the patient's chief complaint of nasal congestion and a clear runny nose, sensitive and burning pain in the tonsils, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx, and coughing up blood. Additionally, the patient has been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks and lives with 4 or more people. She also attends or works in a daycare. The patient is a smoker and is immunosuppressed.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is insufficient evidence to support the diagnosis of COVID-19. While the patient is experiencing symptoms that are commonly associated with COVID-19, such as nasal congestion and coughing up blood, these symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 and can be caused by a variety of other conditions. Additionally, there is no information provided about the patient's test results for COVID-19, which would be the gold standard for diagnosing the disease.

30,53624,"The evidences for the diagnosis of a panic attack in this patient include:

1. Sudden onset of sharp, cramp-like pain in various locations without a clear trigger.
2. Shortness of breath, which is a common symptom of panic attacks.
3. Feeling of detachment from her own body or surroundings (derealization).
4. Fear of dying, which is often reported during panic attacks.
5. History of chronic anxiety, which is a risk factor for panic attacks.
6. Absence of travel or other new exposures that might suggest an alternative diagnosis.

These symptoms align with the DSM-5 criteria for panic attacks, which include an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of a list of physical and cognitive symptoms occur. The patient's symptoms and history suggest that a panic attack could be a contributing factor to her presentation.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a diagnosis of panic attack. Firstly, the patient reported experiencing sharp, cramp-like pain in various locations, including the left side of the chest, right flank, right iliac fossa, pubis, and right breast. However, the pain did not radiate to another location and was not precisely located, which is a common feature of panic attacks.

31,124418,"The evidences for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis from the clinical note include:

1. Symptoms of upper respiratory infection: The patient presents with nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, and a cough, which are common symptoms of viral pharyngitis.
2. Fever: The patient reports having a fever, which often accompanies viral infections, including viral pharyngitis.
3. Contact with infected individual: The patient has been in contact with a person with similar symptoms, suggesting possible transmission of a viral infection.
4. Immunocompromised state: The patient's immunosuppressed status makes them more susceptible to viral infections, including viral pharyngitis.
5. Absence of travel history: No recent travel reduces the likelihood of exotic or travel-related infections, making common viral infections like pharyngitis more probable.

Further diagnostic tests such as throat culture can help confirm the presence of a viral agent.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this case is the patient's history of a cough, fever, and nasal congestion, which are common symptoms of viral pharyngitis. Additionally, the patient's history of contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks and living with 4 or more people increases the likelihood of a viral infection. The patient's history of smoking and immunosuppression may also increase the likelihood of a viral infection. However, it is important to note that these symptoms are also common in bacterial pharyngitis and other respiratory infections, so further testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in the given admission note is that the patient presents with a variety of symptoms including coughing up blood, pain in the throat, thyroid cartilage, pharynx, and under the jaw.

34,14391,"The evidences for the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis in the patient's clinical note include:

1. Location and Quality of Pain: The patient describes burning and sharp pain in the mouth, forehead, right cheek, nose, and right temple, which are common areas affected by sinusitis.

2. Radiating Pain: Pain radiating to the back of the head and temples can be associated with sinus inflammation.

3. Recent Upper Respiratory Infection: The patient reports having had a cold in the last 2 weeks, which can precede or exacerbate sinusitis.

4. Nasal Symptoms: The patient's cough and nasal congestion or clear runny nose are typical symptoms of sinusitis.

5. Past Medical History: The patient's history of asthma and a deviated nasal septum can predispose to chronic rhinosinusitis due to impaired sinus ventilation and drainage.

1. Clinical symptoms: The patient presents with a sore throat and cough, which are common symptoms of URTI.
2. Contact history: The patient has been in contact with another person with similar symptoms, suggesting possible transmission of an infectious agent.
3. Social setting: The patient lives with multiple people and works in a daycare, environments that increase the risk of respiratory infection transmission.
4. Absence of significant past medical history: No other underlying conditions have been reported that would suggest an alternative diagnosis.
5. Physical examination: The patient appears alert and oriented but presents with symptoms consistent with URTI (sore throat and cough).","The evidence for the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in this case is the patient's chief complaint of a sore throat and cough, as well as the patient's history of contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks, living with 4 or more people, and attending or working in a daycare. These factors increase the likelihood of the patient having an URTI. However, it is important to note that other conditions such as tonsillitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and allergic rhinitis can also present with sore throat and cough, so further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of URTI.","The evidence for the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the provided admission note is the patient's chief complaint of a sore throat, as well as the patient's history of contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks, living with 4 or more people, and attending or working in a daycare.

URTIs are infections of the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx, and trachea. Symptoms of URTIs can include a sore throat, cough, runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, fever, and headache. The patient's history of contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks also increases the likelihood of a URTI diagnosis, as URTIs are often caused by viral or bacterial infections that are easily transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces.

1. Persistent cough: Chronic cough can be a symptom of GERD.
2. Pain in the lower chest and upper abdomen: Common areas affected by acid reflux.
3. Burning sensation from the stomach to the throat: Indicates acid regurgitation, typical of GERD.
4. Bitter taste in the mouth: Suggestive of acid reflux into the mouth.
5. Symptoms worsening after eating: A hallmark of GERD, as food intake can exacerbate reflux.
6. History of hiatal hernia: Increases the risk of GERD, as the hernia can impair the function of the lower esophageal sphincter.
7. Black stools: May indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur with severe GERD or complications such as esophagitis or peptic ulcers.
8. Lifestyle factors: Obesity, alcohol, and smoking are risk factors for developing GERD.","The evidence for the diagnosis of GERD in the given admission note is the patient's report of a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat, associated with a bitter taste in the mouth. This symptom is known as acid regurgitation, which is the most common symptom of GERD.

41,79564,"The evidences for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis from the clinical note include:

1. Symmetrical pain in the fingers, described as burning and sharp, which could be indicative of granulomatous inflammation affecting peripheral nerves.
2. Swollen or painful lymph nodes, which are common in sarcoidosis due to granulomatous infiltration.
3. Episodes of loss of consciousness with muscle contractions, which may suggest neurosarcoidosis affecting the central nervous system.
4. Shortness of breath, which could be related to pulmonary involvement, a common feature of sarcoidosis.
5. Diffuse redness in one or both eyes, which may indicate ocular sarcoidosis, such as uveitis or conjunctivitis.

These symptoms collectively suggest the possibility of sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disorder, which often presents with lymphadenopathy, pulmonary and ocular involvement, and potential neurological manifestations.

46,85556,"The evidences for the diagnosis of myocarditis in this clinical note include:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain described as a ""knife stroke,"" shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue can be associated with myocarditis, especially following a recent viral infection.

2. **Recent Viral Infection**: Myocarditis is often preceded by a viral infection, which the patient recently experienced.

3. **Lack of Travel History**: The absence of recent travel reduces the likelihood of other causes of chest pain related to travel, such as pulmonary embolism from prolonged immobilization during travel.

4. **No Other Significant Past Medical History**: The lack of other significant conditions or cardiovascular risk factors makes primary cardiac events like angina or myocardial infarction less likely, though not impossible, and raises the index of suspicion for myocarditis.

Further diagnostic tests such as EKG, chest X-ray, and cardiac enzymes would be necessary to support the diagnosis of myocarditis by showing evidence of cardiac inflammation and injury.","Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the heart muscle that can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections, bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, drugs, and toxins.

47,122427,"The evidences for the diagnosis of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in this patient include:

1. Fever: The patient's chief complaint of fever is a common symptom associated with infections, including URTIs.
2. Cough with colored or abundant sputum: This indicates the presence of an infection in the respiratory tract, as clear sputum typically becomes colored or more abundant due to the presence of white blood cells and other byproducts of an immune response.
3. Nasal congestion and clear runny nose: These symptoms are indicative of inflammation and irritation in the nasal passages and sinuses, which are common in URTIs.
4. Pain in the left cheek and right temple: This localized pain may suggest sinus involvement, which is consistent with sinusitis, a type of URTI.
5. Smoking history: Smoking is a risk factor for respiratory infections due to its impact on mucociliary clearance and immune function in the respiratory tract.

The combination of these symptoms and risk factors supports the suspicion of a URTI, possibly with sinusitis. Further diagnostic tests, such as a CBC and chest X-ray, are planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the infection.","The evidence for the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the given admission note is the patient's complaint of increased sweating, diffuse muscle pain, and a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual. Additionally, the patient's report of nasal congestion and a clear runny nose further supports the diagnosis of URTI.

48,63385,"The evidences for the diagnosis of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in this patient include:

1. Persistent cough: A common symptom of URTI.
2. Sore throat: Often associated with URTI.
3. Diffuse muscle pain: Can be a systemic symptom of infection.
4. Increased sweating: May indicate fever or the body's response to infection.
5. Contact with a person with similar symptoms: Suggests possible transmission of an infectious agent.
6. Sudden onset of symptoms: Typical of acute infections like URTI.
7. No significant past medical history: Makes chronic conditions less likely.
8. Absence of medication and allergies: Reduces the likelihood of drug-induced or allergic causes of symptoms.

These clinical findings collectively support the suspicion of an URTI.","The evidence for the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in this case is the patient's persistent cough, increased sweating, diffuse muscle pain, and a sore throat. These symptoms are common in patients with URTI, which is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, and larynx.

Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the lungs. The main symptoms of bronchitis are cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing. Other symptoms can include fever, chest congestion, and fatigue. The admission note mentions that the patient is experiencing shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing upon exhalation, which are symptoms of bronchitis. However, the note does not provide any evidence of inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which is the defining characteristic of bronchitis. Additionally, the note mentions that the patient is experiencing a burning sensation in the lower chest and posterior chest wall (left side), which is not a typical symptom of bronchitis. Therefore, based on the information provided in the admission note, there are no clear evidences for the diagnosis of bronchitis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of bronchitis. While the patient is experiencing respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing upon exhalation, these symptoms are not specific to bronchitis and could be indicative of a variety of other respiratory conditions. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) further complicates the situation and makes it difficult to determine whether the patient is experiencing an exacerbation of their COPD or a separate respiratory infection such as bronchitis. Therefore, further diagnostic testing and evaluation are necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's respiratory symptoms and make a definitive diagnosis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a diagnosis of bronchitis. Firstly, the patient is experiencing a burning sensation in the lower chest and posterior chest wall (left side), which is a common symptom of bronchitis. Secondly, the patient is experiencing a cough, which is also a common symptom of bronchitis. Additionally, the patient is experiencing [MASK], fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, and a [MASK] sound when exhaling. These symptoms are also commonly associated with bronchitis. Finally, the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which puts them at a higher risk for developing bronchitis. Overall, the combination of these symptoms and the patient's history of COPD provide strong evidence for a diagnosis of bronchitis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of [MASK]. While the patient reports experiencing a burning sensation in the lower chest and posterior chest wall (left side), this symptom alone is not specific to [MASK] and could be indicative of a number of other conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophagitis, or costochondritis. The patient's report of [MASK], fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, cough, and a [MASK] sound when exhaling are also nonspecific and could be indicative of a number of respiratory infections, including influenza, common cold, or COVID-19. The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking history may also be relevant, as these factors can increase the risk of respiratory infections.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of [MASK]. While the patient reports experiencing a burning sensation in the lower chest and posterior chest wall (left side), this symptom alone is not specific to [MASK] and could be indicative of a variety of other conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, costochondritis, or musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, the patient's report of [MASK], fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, [MASK], and a [MASK] sound when exhaling, as well as the patient's history of COPD, further complicates the differential diagnosis.","

56,24187,"The evidences for the diagnosis of anemia in this patient include:

1. Symptoms consistent with anemia: The patient reports fatigue, non-restful sleep, shortness of breath, dizziness, and paleness of the skin, which are common symptoms associated with anemia.
2. Pain in the forehead and right temple: While not specific to anemia, this pain could be related to the general symptoms of fatigue and malaise that accompany anemia.
3. History of anemia: The patient has a past medical history of anemia, which increases the likelihood of a current anemic condition.
4. Underweight status: The patient's BMI is less than 18.5, indicating underweight, which can be associated with nutritional deficiencies that may lead to anemia.
5. Physical examination: The patient appears fatigued and pale on examination, which are physical signs that can be indicative of anemia.
6. Medication: The patient is on NOACs, which can sometimes lead to bleeding complications that might result in anemia if there is chronic blood loss.

1. Extreme fatigue and weakness: Common symptoms of anemia due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Dizziness and lightheadedness: Can occur due to decreased hemoglobin and reduced oxygen to the brain.
3. Shortness of breath: Reflects the body's attempt to increase oxygen delivery by breathing more rapidly, a compensatory mechanism in anemia.
4. Pale appearance: Pallor is a classic sign of anemia, indicating reduced hemoglobin and red blood cell count.
5. Poor diet and low BMI: Suggests possible nutritional deficiencies that can lead to anemia, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency.

64,38957,"The evidences for the diagnosis of anemia in this patient include:

1. Severe, exhausting pain in multiple locations on her head, which can be a symptom of anemia due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Lightheadedness and dizziness, which are common symptoms of anemia caused by decreased oxygen supply to the brain.
3. Extreme fatigue and the patient being bedridden, which are consistent with the weakness and energy depletion seen in anemic patients.
4. Black stools and light red blood or blood clots in her stool, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to iron-deficiency anemia.
5. Underweight with a BMI less than 18.5, suggesting possible nutritional deficiencies that could contribute to anemia.
6. Pregnancy, which increases the risk of anemia due to higher iron and folate requirements.

Further blood tests would be needed to confirm the diagnosis by checking hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, and other relevant parameters.","The evidence for the diagnosis of anemia in this case is the patient's report of black stools and light red blood or blood clots in her stool. Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells (RBCs) is lower than normal or their ability to carry oxygen is impaired. This can result in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Anemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including blood loss, decreased production of RBCs, and increased destruction of RBCs. In this case, the patient's report of black stools and light red blood or blood clots in her stool suggests that she may be experiencing blood loss, which could be a sign of anemia. It is important to note that other conditions, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can also cause black stools, so it is important to consider other possible diagnoses in addition to anemia. However, based on the information provided in the admission note, anemia appears to be a likely diagnosis in this case.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of [MASK].

65,24856,"The clinical note provided does not contain sufficient evidence to diagnose sarcoidosis, especially considering the patient's age (2 years old) and the non-specific nature of the symptoms. Sarcoidosis is rare in this age group and typically presents with more specific systemic symptoms and radiographic findings. The symptoms described, such as redness in the eyes, could suggest conjunctivitis, and the swollen or painful lymph nodes could be indicative of an infection or other inflammatory conditions. The loss of consciousness with muscle contractions could suggest seizure activity, which is not typically associated with sarcoidosis. To diagnose sarcoidosis, one would expect to find evidence of non-caseating granulomas on biopsy, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest imaging, and possibly elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, none of which are mentioned in the clinical note. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no evidence to support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in this case is the presence of diffuse (widespread) redness in one or both eyes, swollen or painful lymph nodes, loss of consciousness associated with violent and sustained muscle contractions, and pain in various locations including the left shoulder, right index finger, left index finger, left ring finger, and the palmar face of the right wrist. The onset, duration, and severity of these symptoms are not specified. There are no known aggravating or alleviating factors. There is no relevant history of prior treatments or leading events. The patient has no known significant conditions such as diabetes or allergies. The patient has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.

These granulomas can be found in skin, lymph nodes, lungs, liver, spleen, eyes, and other organs. In addition to the presence of granulomas, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis also requires the exclusion of other diseases that can cause granuloma formation, such as tuberculosis, fungal infections, and other granulomatous diseases.","The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas, which are clusters of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells, in one or more organs.

67,120208,"The evidences for the diagnosis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) in this patient include:

1. Symptomatology: The patient's report of sharp, burning pain in the mouth, forehead, cheeks, and nose, with pain radiating to the temples, is consistent with sinus pain, a common symptom of CRS.

2. Nasal Discharge: The presence of greenish or yellowish nasal discharge suggests purulent secretions, which are indicative of an infection and commonly seen in CRS.

3. Cough: A cough can be associated with postnasal drip, which is a symptom that can occur in CRS due to mucus draining from the sinuses into the throat.

4. History of Nasal Polyps: Nasal polyps are associated with chronic inflammation of the sinuses and are a common finding in CRS.

5. History of Deviated Nasal Septum: A deviated septum can impede sinus drainage and predispose to sinus infections, potentially contributing to CRS.

6. History of Asthma: There is a known association between asthma and CRS, with inflammation affecting both the lower and upper airways.

7. Smoking History: Smoking can exacerbate inflammation and mucociliary dysfunction, increasing the risk of developing CRS.

68,20445,"The evidences for the diagnosis of acute COPD exacerbation/infection in this patient are:

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: The patient's increasing shortness of breath and wheezing, particularly with a history of several flare-ups in the past year, are consistent with symptoms of an acute exacerbation of COPD.

2. **Past Medical History (PMH)**: The patient has a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which predisposes him to exacerbations.

3. **Occupational History**: The patient's work in construction and mining, which are environments with exposure to dust and chemicals, can aggravate COPD and increase the risk of exacerbations.

4. **Physical Examination (PE)**: The patient's appearance of distress and difficulty breathing upon examination supports the presence of an acute respiratory issue, likely related to his underlying COPD.

The combination of the patient's symptoms, history of COPD, occupational exposures, and physical distress are indicative of an acute exacerbation of COPD, and possibly an infection if there are signs of fever or purulent sputum, which would need to be confirmed with further diagnostic tests such as sputum culture, chest imaging, and pulmonary function tests.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a diagnosis of acute COPD exacerbation/infection. First, the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been experiencing shortness of breath for the past few weeks. Second, the patient has had several flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the past year. Third, the patient has a history of working in construction and the mining sector, which may have contributed to his respiratory issues. Finally, the patient appears to be in distress due to difficulty breathing. Taken together, these factors suggest that the patient may be experiencing an acute COPD exacerbation/infection.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is not enough evidence to support a diagnosis of [MASK] / infection. The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the presence of a wheezing sound when exhaling are suggestive of an exacerbation of COPD rather than an infection. The patient's shortness of breath and difficulty breathing may be related to his COPD exacerbation rather than an infection. The patient's history of working in construction and the mining sector may have contributed to his respiratory issues, but there is not enough information provided to determine if the patient has been exposed to any specific environmental factors that could be related to an infection. The patient's past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux is not related to his current symptoms of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

Third, the patient has a history of working in construction and the mining sector, which may have contributed to his COPD exacerbation. Fourth, the patient has had several flare-ups of his COPD in the past year, which is another common symptom of COPD exacerbation.

73,36093,"The evidences for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in this patient are:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient's sharp, localized pain that increases with deep breathing and radiates to various locations, along with significant shortness of breath, are consistent with symptoms of PE.

2. **History of DVT**: The patient has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis, which is a known risk factor for PE as clots can dislodge and travel to the lungs.

3. **Recent Surgery**: Surgery within the last month is a risk factor for PE due to potential immobility and hypercoagulability postoperatively.

4. **Prolonged Immobility**: The patient has been immobile for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks, which increases the risk of clot formation.

5. **Travel History**: Long-distance travel, such as flying to North America, is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including PE.

These factors combined with the clinical presentation suggest a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism, warranting immediate diagnostic testing.","The evidence for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in this case is the sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain that radiates to the left side of the chest, right scapula, and left posterior chest wall.

The patient's symptoms include pain in the right tonsil, palate, pharynx, and under the jaw, with a sensitive and burning character, and a fever. These symptoms are more suggestive of a possible tonsillitis or pharyngitis rather than laryngitis, which typically presents with hoarseness or loss of voice, cough, and throat irritation. The absence of specific laryngitis symptoms such as hoarseness in the clinical note means there is no direct evidence to support a diagnosis of acute laryngitis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of acute laryngitis in this case is the patient's chief complaint of sensitive and burning pain in the right tonsil, palate, pharynx, and under the jaw. Additionally, the patient reported a fever. These symptoms are consistent with acute laryngitis, which typically presents with a sore or scratchy throat, cough, fever, and difficulty swallowing. However, it is important to note that there are other potential causes of these symptoms, such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Therefore, further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of acute laryngitis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of acute laryngitis in the given admission note is the patient's chief complaint of ""sensitive and sore throat in various areas including the right tonsil, palace, pharynx, and under the jaw"" and the history of present illness of ""sensitive and sore throat in various areas including the right tonsil, palace, pharynx, and under the jaw"".

1. Chief Complaint (CC): The patient reports an irregular or disorganized heartbeat, which is a common symptom of AF.
2. History of Present Illness (HPI): Symptoms of irregular heartbeats (palpitations) and dizziness, which can be associated with AF, especially when symptoms increase with exertion and improve with rest.
3. Past Medical History (PMH): Known heart valve issue and heart defect, both of which are risk factors for developing AF.
4. Physical Examination (PE): Irregular heart rhythm noted during the exam, which is a key clinical sign of AF.

Further diagnostic tests such as an EKG (to confirm the presence of an irregular, often rapid heart rate that characterizes AF) and an echocardiogram (to visualize heart valve function and structure) would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in this case is the patient's report of irregular heartbeats, palpitations, and occasional dizziness. These symptoms are consistent with atrial fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia in which the heart beats irregularly. The patient's past medical history of a known issue with one of her heart valves and a known heart defect also increase her risk for atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings of an irregular heart rhythm and palpitations further support the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.","The evidence for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in this case is the patient's report of irregular heartbeats, palpitations, and occasional dizziness.

86,30376,"The evidences for the diagnosis of acute dystonic reactions in this patient include:

1. Recent initiation of antipsychotic medication: Acute dystonic reactions are often associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs, particularly soon after the start of treatment.

2. Difficulty in controlling eye movements: Oculogyric crisis, a type of dystonia involving sustained, involuntary upward deviation of the eyes, is a common symptom.

3. Muscle spasms and soreness in the neck: Cervical dystonia, which presents as involuntary contractions of the neck muscles, causing abnormal movements and postures of the neck.

4. Difficulty in opening the mouth: Oromandibular dystonia can affect the muscles of the jaw and mouth, leading to difficulties in mouth opening.

5. Trouble keeping the tongue in the mouth: Lingual dystonia involves involuntary tongue movements.

6. No alleviating factors: Acute dystonic reactions typically do not have specific alleviating factors and can persist until treated.

87,5106,"The evidences for the diagnosis of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in this 9-year-old patient include:

1. Cough: A common symptom of URTI.
2. Fever and sore throat: Indicative of an infectious process, often seen in URTI.
3. Diffuse muscle pain: Can be associated with systemic viral infections that affect the upper respiratory tract.
4. Contact with a person with similar symptoms: Suggests a contagious respiratory infection, which is consistent with URTI.
5. Attendance at daycare: Increases the risk of contracting infectious diseases like URTI due to close contact with other children.","The evidence for the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in this case is the patient's presenting symptoms of cough, increased sweating, and diffuse muscle pain, as well as the patient's history of contact with a person with similar symptoms and attendance at a daycare.

1. Pain description: The patient describes pain as haunting, sensitive, burning, sickening, and scary, which are characteristic descriptors of the discomfort caused by acid reflux.
2. Pain location: The pain is located in the upper chest, hypochondrium (L), and epigastric region, common areas affected by GERD.
3. Pain radiation: The pain radiates to the lower chest and upper chest, consistent with the distribution of esophageal discomfort in GERD.
4. Sudden onset: The pain appeared quickly in the upper chest, which can be indicative of acute acid reflux episodes.
5. Associated symptoms: The patient reports a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat, along with a bitter taste in the mouth, both hallmark symptoms of GERD.
6. Positional exacerbation: Symptoms worsen when lying down and are alleviated while sitting up, suggesting that gravity influences the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.
7. Past medical history: The patient has a history of hiatal hernia, which is a known risk factor for GERD as it can facilitate the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus.","The evidence for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the given admission note is the patient's description of her pain as haunting, sensitive, burning, sickening, and scary.

These symptoms are consistent with the definition of GERD, which is a condition in which stomach acid or contents of the stomach flow back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn and acid reflux. The patient's history of a hiatal hernia also supports the diagnosis of GERD, as hiatal hernias are a common cause of GERD.

1. **Symptoms Exacerbated by Exertion, Relieved by Rest**: The patient's symptoms increase with physical activity and alleviate with rest, which is characteristic of stable angina.
2. **Location and Radiation of Pain**: The patient experiences pain in the left side of the chest, upper chest, and epigastric region, radiating to the right bicep, under the jaw, and right shoulder, which are common sites for referred pain from the heart.
3. **Past Medical History**: The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a personal history of heart attack or angina.
4. **Family History**: There is a family history of early cardiovascular disease, which increases the patient's risk for angina.

4. A history of heart disease (previous heart attack or angina), which increases the risk of subsequent cardiac events.
5. Risk factors such as significant overweight, high cholesterol, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking, all of which contribute to coronary artery disease and unstable angina.

95,34317,"The evidences for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this patient include:

1. Pain in the throat and under the jaw, which is sensitive and burning in nature.
2. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a clear runny nose, which are common in viral upper respiratory infections.
3. Presence of a cough, which often accompanies viral infections of the throat.
4. The absence of travel history, which reduces the likelihood of exotic or travel-related infections.
5. The patient's immunosuppressed state, which increases vulnerability to common viral infections.

These clinical features are consistent with viral pharyngitis, although a throat swab would be necessary to rule out bacterial infection and confirm the viral etiology.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in the given admission note is that the patient is experiencing pain in various areas including the right and left tonsils, thyroid cartilage, pharynx, and under the jaw. The pain is characterized as sensitive and burning. The patient also reports symptoms of nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, and a cough. The patient denies any recent travel out of the country. The patient is a smoker and lives with four or more people. The patient is also immunosuppressed. The patient reports that the onset of pain in the throat and under the jaw, which is sensitive and burning in nature. The patient denies any recent travel out of the country. The patient is a smoker and lives with four or more people. The patient is also immunosuppressed.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this case is the patient's chief complaint of sensitive and burning pain in the throat and under the jaw, which is a common symptom of viral pharyngitis. Additionally, the patient's other symptoms of nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, and cough are also consistent with viral pharyngitis. The patient's past medical history of immunosuppression may also be a risk factor for viral pharyngitis. However, it is important to note that viral pharyngitis can also be caused by other viruses such as adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis of viral pharyngitis cannot be made based solely on the patient's symptoms and medical history. Further testing, such as a throat swab and viral culture, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis.","The evidence for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in the given admission note is that the patient is experiencing sore throat in various areas including the right and left pharynx, thyroid cartilage, and under the jaw. The sore throat is characterized as burning and stabbing in nature. The patient also reports symptoms of nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, and a cough. The patient denies any recent travel out of the country. The patient is a smoker and lives with five people. The patient is also diabetic.","The diagnosis of viral pharyngitis cannot be made based on the information provided in the admission note. Viral pharyngitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that other causes of pharyngitis need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of viral pharyngitis can be made. In order to make a diagnosis of viral pharyngitis, it is necessary to rule out other causes of pharyngitis such as bacterial pharyngitis, tonsillitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, mononucleosis, allergic pharyngitis, and pharyngitis caused by other viruses such as herpes simplex virus. Based on the information provided in the admission note, it is not possible to rule out these other causes of pharyngitis. Therefore, it is not possible to make a diagnosis of viral pharyngitis based on the information provided in the admission note.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of [MASK]. While the patient reports experiencing [MASK] in various areas including the right and left [MASK], [MASK] cartilage, pharynx, and under the jaw, these symptoms alone are not specific to [MASK] and could be indicative of a variety of other conditions. Additionally, the patient also reports [MASK] of [MASK], a [MASK] [MASK], and a [MASK], which further complicates the ability to make a definitive diagnosis of [MASK] based solely on the information provided in the admission note.","
