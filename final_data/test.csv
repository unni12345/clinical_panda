The patient's guardian should monitor the patient closely and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen.. What are the evidences for the diagnosis of Sarcoidosis? Answer very concisely.","The clinical note provided does not contain sufficient evidence to diagnose sarcoidosis, especially considering the patient's age (2 years old) and the non-specific nature of the symptoms. Sarcoidosis is rare in this age group and typically presents with more specific systemic symptoms and radiographic findings. The symptoms described, such as redness in the eyes, could suggest conjunctivitis, and the swollen or painful lymph nodes could be indicative of an infection or other inflammatory conditions. The loss of consciousness with muscle contractions could suggest seizure activity, which is not typically associated with sarcoidosis. To diagnose sarcoidosis, one would expect to find evidence of non-caseating granulomas on biopsy, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest imaging, and possibly elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, none of which are mentioned in the clinical note. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no evidence to support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis."

Relevant positive findings related to the chief complaint include the patient's reported pain in the upper chest, hypochondrium (L), and epigastric region, as well as the burning sensation starting in the stomach and going up into the throat.

Assessment: 
The patient's symptoms suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue, potentially related to her known hiatal hernia. The burning sensation and bitter taste in the mouth, along with the worsening of symptoms when lying down, suggest possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Plan: 
The initial plan includes further diagnostic testing to confirm the suspected diagnosis of GERD. This may include an upper endoscopy or a 24-hour pH probe study. If GERD is confirmed, treatment options may include lifestyle modifications, over-the-counter or prescription medications, or in some cases, surgery. The patient's asthma should also be monitored closely, as GERD can sometimes exacerbate asthma symptoms.. What are the evidences for the diagnosis of GERD? Answer very concisely.","The evidences for the diagnosis of GERD in this patient are:

1. Pain description: The patient describes pain as haunting, sensitive, burning, sickening, and scary, which are characteristic descriptors of the discomfort caused by acid reflux.
2. Pain location: The pain is located in the upper chest, hypochondrium (L), and epigastric region, common areas affected by GERD.
3. Pain radiation: The pain radiates to the lower chest and upper chest, consistent with the distribution of esophageal discomfort in GERD.
4. Sudden onset: The pain appeared quickly in the upper chest, which can be indicative of acute acid reflux episodes.
5. Associated symptoms: The patient reports a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat, along with a bitter taste in the mouth, both hallmark symptoms of GERD.
6. Positional exacerbation: Symptoms worsen when lying down and are alleviated while sitting up, suggesting that gravity influences the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.
7. Past medical history: The patient has a history of hiatal hernia, which is a known risk factor for GERD as it can facilitate the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus."
