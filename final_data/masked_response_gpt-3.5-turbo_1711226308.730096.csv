1. Chief Complaint (CC): The patient reports symptoms of heart racing and palpitations, which are common presentations of AF.
2. History of Present Illness (HPI): Palpitations and shortness of breath that worsen with exertion and improve with rest could indicate paroxysmal AF.
3. Past Medical History (PMH): The patient has a history of heart valve issues and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for the development of AF.
4. Exacerbating Factors: Physical exertion exacerbating the symptoms is consistent with the exercise intolerance seen in AF.

Further diagnostic tests such as an EKG would be required to confirm the presence of AF by demonstrating an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves.

1. **Nocturnal Dyspnea**: The patient reports waking up at night with shortness of breath and choking, which are classic symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, a key feature of heart failure and pulmonary edema.

2. **Orthopnea**: Symptoms worsening when lying down and improving when sitting up suggest orthopnea, commonly associated with pulmonary edema due to heart failure.

3. **Past Medical History**: The patient has a history of heart-related issues, including fluid in the lungs, heart attack or angina, and heart failure, which predispose her to acute pulmonary edema.

4. **Peripheral Edema**: Swelling in the ankles, calves, and tibia indicates fluid retention, which can be a sign of heart failure leading to pulmonary edema.

5. **Exertional Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath that increases with physical exertion and alleviates with rest is consistent with the exercise intolerance seen in heart failure and pulmonary edema.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain described as a ""knife stroke,"" shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue can be associated with myocarditis, especially following a recent viral infection.

2. **Recent Viral Infection**: Myocarditis is often preceded by a viral infection, which the patient recently experienced.

3. **Lack of Travel History**: The absence of recent travel reduces the likelihood of other causes of chest pain related to travel, such as pulmonary embolism from prolonged immobilization during travel.

4. **No Other Significant Past Medical History**: The lack of other significant conditions or cardiovascular risk factors makes primary cardiac events like angina or myocardial infarction less likely, though not impossible, and raises the index of suspicion for myocarditis.

Further diagnostic tests such as EKG, chest X-ray, and cardiac enzymes would be necessary to support the diagnosis of myocarditis by showing evidence of cardiac inflammation and injury.","Evidences for the diagnosis of Myocarditis include:
1. Chest pain described as a ""knife stroke"" in the upper chest, right and left breast.
2. Shortness of breath, palpitations, and general discomfort and fatigue.
3. Recent viral infection in the past medical history.","Evidences for the diagnosis of Myocarditis based on the clinical note include:
1. Chest pain described as a ""knife stroke"" in the upper chest, right and left breast.
2. Palpitations.
3. General feeling of malaise and fatigue.
4. Recent history of a viral infection.","The clinical note suggests a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling unwell, along with the risk factors of age and male sex. The recent viral infection may have triggered the ACS event.","The patient's clinical presentation of chest pain, discomfort, palpitations, and fatigue, along with a recent history of myocardial infarction, suggests a diagnosis of unstable angina.","The patient's clinical note suggests a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) based on the symptoms of chest pain described as ""crushing"" in the upper chest, along with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and a general feeling of malaise and weakness. The recent history of a heart surgery also raises suspicion for cardiac issues.","Admission Note: Admission Note: Patient Details:

47,122427,"The evidences for the diagnosis of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in this patient include:

1. Fever: The patient's chief complaint of fever is a common symptom associated with infections, including URTIs.
2. Cough with colored or abundant sputum: This indicates the presence of an infection in the respiratory tract, as clear sputum typically becomes colored or more abundant due to the presence of white blood cells and other byproducts of an immune response.
3. Nasal congestion and clear runny nose: These symptoms are indicative of inflammation and irritation in the nasal passages and sinuses, which are common in URTIs.
4. Pain in the left cheek and right temple: This localized pain may suggest sinus involvement, which is consistent with sinusitis, a type of URTI.
5. Smoking history: Smoking is a risk factor for respiratory infections due to its impact on mucociliary clearance and immune function in the respiratory tract.

The combination of these symptoms and risk factors supports the suspicion of a URTI, possibly with sinusitis. Further diagnostic tests, such as a CBC and chest X-ray, are planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the infection.","Evidence for the diagnosis of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) includes:

65,24856,"The clinical note provided does not contain sufficient evidence to diagnose sarcoidosis, especially considering the patient's age (2 years old) and the non-specific nature of the symptoms.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient's sharp, localized pain that increases with deep breathing and radiates to various locations, along with significant shortness of breath, are consistent with symptoms of PE.

2. **History of DVT**: The patient has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis, which is a known risk factor for PE as clots can dislodge and travel to the lungs.

3. **Recent Surgery**: Surgery within the last month is a risk factor for PE due to potential immobility and hypercoagulability postoperatively.

4. **Prolonged Immobility**: The patient has been immobile for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks, which increases the risk of clot formation.

5. **Travel History**: Long-distance travel, such as flying to North America, is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including PE.
