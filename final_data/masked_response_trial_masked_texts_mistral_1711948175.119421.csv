6,988,"The evidences for the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) in this newborn patient include:

1. Clinical symptoms: The patient presents with muscle weakness, difficulty opening or raising eyelids (ptosis), jaw pain or weakness, double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, and generalized weakness, which are characteristic of MG.

2. Exacerbation with fatigue: Symptoms reported to increase with fatigue and stress, which is typical of MG due to the depletion of acetylcholine receptors during sustained muscle activity.

3. Family history: There is a known family history of myasthenia gravis, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition to the condition.

Further diagnostic testing as outlined in the plan (antibody tests, nerve conduction studies, and imaging) would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of difficulty opening or raising one or both eyelids is a classic symptom of MG. MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, which is the point where nerve fibers communicate with muscle fibers. In MG, the immune system produces antibodies that interfere with the normal functioning of the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. 

Secondly, the patient's history of muscle weakness, including difficulty opening or raising eyelids, pain or weakness in the jaw, double vision, shortness of breath, and generalized weakness in both arms and legs, is consistent with the symptoms of MG. MG can affect different parts of the body, including the eyes, face, neck, chest, arms, and legs. 

Thirdly, the patient's family history of MG is a significant risk factor for the development of the disorder. MG is more likely to occur if there is a family history of","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis:

1. Family history of myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is an inherited disorder, and having a family history of the condition increases the likelihood of a diagnosis.
2. Symptoms of muscle weakness: The patient reports difficulty opening or raising eyelids, pain or weakness in the jaw, double vision, shortness of breath, and generalized weakness in both arms and legs. These are classic symptoms of myasthenia gravis.
3. Increase in symptoms with fatigue and stress: Myasthenia gravis is characterized by a worsening of symptoms with fatigue and stress, which is consistent with the patient's reported experience.
4. No recent travel out of the country: Myasthenia gravis is not typically caused by exposure to toxins or infections, and there is no history of recent travel out of the country, which helps to rule out these possibilities.

While these pieces of evidence suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, further testing and evaluation by a healthcare professional would be necessary to confirm","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint is difficulty opening or raising one or both eyelids, which is a common symptom of MG. MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between nerve cells and muscle cells, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. 

Secondly, the patient has a family history of MG, which is a strong risk factor for the development of the disease. 

Thirdly, the patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and difficulty with vision due to eyelid drooping increase with fatigue and stress, which are also common symptoms of MG. 

Finally, the patient's physical examination shows muscle weakness and difficulty with vision due to eyelid drooping, which are consistent with the symptoms of MG. 

Overall, the combination of the patient's chief complaint, family history, symptoms, and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of MG. Further testing, such as an electromyography (EMG) and single fiber electromyography (S","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) ophthalmoplegia:

1. Chief Complaint (CC): The patient is having a hard time opening/raising one or both eyes, which is a common symptom of MG ophthalmoplegia.
2. History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is experiencing a range of symptoms that are consistent with MG ophthalmoplegia, including difficulty opening or raising the eyelids, double vision, weakness in the jaw, and generalized weakness in both arms and legs. These symptoms are known to worsen with stress or exertion, which is also consistent with MG.
3. Past Medical History (PMH): There is a family history of MG, which increases the patient's risk of developing the condition.
4. Physical Examination (PE): The patient appears to be experiencing ptosis (eyelid drooping) and diplopia (double vision), which are classic symptoms of MG ophthalmoplegia.

Overall, the combination of these symptoms","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). 

Firstly, the patient's symptoms of difficulty opening or raising one or both eyelids, weakness in the jaw, arms, and legs, and increased symptoms with stress or crying are consistent with the symptoms of MG. MG is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between nerve cells and muscle cells, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. 

Secondly, the patient's family history of MG is a significant risk factor for the development of the condition. MG tends to run in families, with up to 30% of patients having a family history of the disorder. 

Finally, the patient's physical examination findings of eyelid drooping and difficulty opening or raising the eyelids are consistent with the ocular symptoms of MG. MG can cause weakness of the muscles that control eye movement, leading to ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) and diplopia (double vision).

2. Shortness of breath with minimal physical effort, which may indicate compromised cardiac function associated with myocarditis.
3. A recent viral infection, which is a common precursor to myocarditis as many cases are caused by a viral etiology.

Further diagnostic tests such as an ECG, cardiac MRI, or blood tests for cardiac biomarkers would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myocarditis. 

Firstly, the patient's symptoms of severe, knife-like pain in the left side of the chest and breast, and shortness of breath with minimal physical effort, are consistent with the symptoms of myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, which can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. 

Secondly, the patient's recent history of a viral infection may be a contributing factor to the development of myocarditis. Viral infections, such as influenza or COVID-19, can cause inflammation in the heart muscle and lead to myocarditis. 

Thirdly, the patient's lack of significant past medical conditions and recent travel history suggest that myocarditis may be a primary diagnosis, rather than a secondary complication of another underlying condition.

2. Pain radiating to the thoracic spine and left scapula, which is consistent with the typical radiation of pain in Boerhaave syndrome.
3. Vomiting, including hematemesis (vomiting blood or coffee-ground-like material), which can occur due to the presence of blood in the esophagus or stomach as a result of the rupture.
4. Excessive alcohol consumption, which is a known risk factor for Boerhaave syndrome due to forceful vomiting episodes that can lead to esophageal tears.

21,6491,"The evidences for the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis in this patient include:

1. Symptoms of upper respiratory infection: The patient's fever and nasal congestion are common symptoms associated with viral infections of the upper respiratory tract.
2. Pain in the thyroid cartilage: This could indicate throat inflammation, which is a symptom of pharyngitis.
3. Contact with infected individuals: The patient's history of being in contact with a person with similar symptoms increases the likelihood of a contagious viral infection.
4. Coughing up blood: While less common in viral pharyngitis, this could be a result of severe throat irritation or a secondary complication.
5. Absence of significant past medical history: This suggests that the current symptoms are likely due to an acute infection rather than a chronic condition.

26,11381,"The evidences for the diagnosis of epiglottitis in this patient include:

1. Voice changes: The patient's deeper, softer, and hoarse voice can be indicative of epiglottis swelling.
2. Pain characteristics: Sharp pain that improves when leaning forward can be associated with epiglottitis, as this position may relieve pressure on the inflamed epiglottis.
3. Pain location: Pain in the tonsils and neck is consistent with the anatomical location of the epiglottis.
4. Sudden onset: Epiglottitis typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms.
5. Fever: The presence of fever suggests an infectious process, which is common in epiglottitis.
6. Increased saliva production: Difficulty swallowing due to a swollen epiglottis can lead to drooling or increased saliva production.

These clinical features support the suspicion of epiglottitis, warranting further investigation such as a throat swab and possibly imaging to confirm the diagnosis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of epiglottitis:

Pain in the tonsils, back of the neck, and sides of the neck: Epiglottitis is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the epiglottis, a flap of tissue at the entrance of the trachea, becomes swollen and blocks the airway. Symptoms of epiglottitis often include pain in the neck and throat, difficulty breathing, and a hoarse voice.
2. Increased saliva production: Epiglottitis can also cause an increase in saliva production.
3. Fever: Epiglottitis can cause a fever as a result of the body's response to the infection or inflammation.
4. History of excessive alcohol consumption and regular use of stimulant drugs: Epiglottitis can be more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system, which can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption and regular use of stimulant drugs.

1. **Nocturnal Dyspnea**: The patient reports waking up at night with shortness of breath and choking, which are classic symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, a key feature of heart failure and pulmonary edema.

2. **Orthopnea**: Symptoms worsening when lying down and improving when sitting up suggest orthopnea, commonly associated with pulmonary edema due to heart failure.

3. **Past Medical History**: The patient has a history of heart-related issues, including fluid in the lungs, heart attack or angina, and heart failure, which predispose her to acute pulmonary edema.

4. **Peripheral Edema**: Swelling in the ankles, calves, and tibia indicates fluid retention, which can be a sign of heart failure leading to pulmonary edema.

5. **Exertional Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath that increases with physical exertion and alleviates with rest is consistent with the exercise intolerance seen in heart failure and pulmonary edema.

41,79564,"The evidences for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis from the clinical note include:

1. Symmetrical pain in the fingers, described as burning and sharp, which could be indicative of granulomatous inflammation affecting peripheral nerves.
2. Swollen or painful lymph nodes, which are common in sarcoidosis due to granulomatous infiltration.
3. Episodes of loss of consciousness with muscle contractions, which may suggest neurosarcoidosis affecting the central nervous system.
4. Shortness of breath, which could be related to pulmonary involvement, a common feature of sarcoidosis.
5. Diffuse redness in one or both eyes, which may indicate ocular sarcoidosis, such as uveitis or conjunctivitis.

These symptoms collectively suggest the possibility of sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disorder, which often presents with lymphadenopathy, pulmonary and ocular involvement, and potential neurological manifestations. However, further diagnostic workup, including chest imaging, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, and possibly tissue biopsy, is required to confirm the diagnosis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of sarcoidosis. 

Firstly, the patient reports experiencing pain in the fingers of both hands, specifically the ring, index, and middle fingers. This pain is described as burning and sharp, which are common symptoms of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect various organs in the body, including the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. In some cases, sarcoidosis can cause inflammation in the joints, including the fingers.

Secondly, the patient reports swollen or painful lymph nodes, episodes of loss of consciousness associated with violent and sustained muscle contractions, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are also consistent with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis can cause inflammation in the lymph nodes, which can lead to swelling and pain.

46,85556,"The evidences for the diagnosis of myocarditis in this clinical note include:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain described as a ""knife stroke,"" shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue can be associated with myocarditis, especially following a recent viral infection.

2. **Recent Viral Infection**: Myocarditis is often preceded by a viral infection, which the patient recently experienced.

3. **Lack of Travel History**: The absence of recent travel reduces the likelihood of other causes of chest pain related to travel, such as pulmonary embolism from prolonged immobilization during travel.

4. **No Other Significant Past Medical History**: The lack of other significant conditions or cardiovascular risk factors makes primary cardiac events like angina or myocardial infarction less likely, though not impossible, and raises the index of suspicion for myocarditis.

Further diagnostic tests such as EKG, chest X-ray, and cardiac enzymes would be necessary to support the diagnosis of myocarditis by showing evidence of cardiac inflammation and injury.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myocarditis:

1. Chest pain: The patient reports chest pain described as a ""knife stroke"" in the upper chest, right and left breast. This type of chest pain is a common symptom of myocarditis.
2. Shortness of breath: The patient reports shortness of breath, which can be a symptom of myocarditis.
3. Palpitations: The patient reports palpitations, which can be a symptom of myocarditis.
4. General feeling of discomfort and fatigue: The patient reports a general feeling of discomfort and fatigue, which can be a symptom of myocarditis.
5. Recent viral infection: The patient recently had a viral infection, which can increase the risk of developing myocarditis.

Overall, the combination of these symptoms and the patient's recent viral infection suggest a possible diagnosis of myocarditis. However, further testing and evaluation by a healthcare professional would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of myocarditis. 

Firstly, the patient reports feeling out of breath with minimal physical effort, which is a common symptom of myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, which can impair the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently, leading to shortness of breath.

Secondly, the patient reports chest pain described as a ""knife stroke"" in the upper chest, right and left. Chest pain is a common symptom of myocarditis, and the location of the pain in the upper chest and both sides of the chest is consistent with myocarditis.

Thirdly, the patient reports palpitations and a general feeling of discomfort and fatigue, which are also common symptoms of myocarditis. Myocarditis can cause abnormal heart rhythms, leading to palpitations, and can also cause fatigue due to the increased workload on the heart.

Finally, the patient recently had a viral infection, which is a known risk factor for myocarditis. Viral in","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of [MASK].

1. Fever: The patient's chief complaint of fever is a common symptom associated with infections, including URTIs.
2. Cough with colored or abundant sputum: This indicates the presence of an infection in the respiratory tract, as clear sputum typically becomes colored or more abundant due to the presence of white blood cells and other byproducts of an immune response.
3. Nasal congestion and clear runny nose: These symptoms are indicative of inflammation and irritation in the nasal passages and sinuses, which are common in URTIs.
4. Pain in the left cheek and right temple: This localized pain may suggest sinus involvement, which is consistent with sinusitis, a type of URTI.
5. Smoking history: Smoking is a risk factor for respiratory infections due to its impact on mucociliary clearance and immune function in the respiratory tract.

The combination of these symptoms and risk factors supports the suspicion of a URTI, possibly with sinusitis. Further diagnostic tests, such as a CBC and chest X-ray, are planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the infection.","The evidence for the diagnosis of URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) from the admission note are:

4. The patient reports nasal congestion and a clear runny nose, which are also common symptoms of URTI.
5. The patient is a smoker, which increases the risk of developing URTI.

48,63385,"The evidences for the diagnosis of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in this patient include:

1. Persistent cough: A common symptom of URTI.
2. Sore throat: Often associated with URTI.
3. Diffuse muscle pain: Can be a systemic symptom of infection.
4. Increased sweating: May indicate fever or the body's response to infection.
5. Contact with a person with similar symptoms: Suggests possible transmission of an infectious agent.
6. Sudden onset of symptoms: Typical of acute infections like URTI.
7. No significant past medical history: Makes chronic conditions less likely.
8. Absence of medication and allergies: Reduces the likelihood of drug-induced or allergic causes of symptoms.

These clinical findings collectively support the suspicion of an URTI.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences that suggest a diagnosis of URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint is a persistent cough, which is a common symptom of URTI. 

Secondly, the patient has reported increased sweating, diffuse muscle pain, and a sore throat, which are also common symptoms of URTI. 

Thirdly, the patient has described the pain as tedious and located in the occiput, with no radiation to other locations, which is consistent with the pain associated with URTI. 

Fourthly, the patient has been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks, which suggests that the patient may have contracted the infection from someone else. 

Overall, the combination of these symptoms and the patient's history of contact with someone else with similar symptoms strongly suggests a diagnosis of URTI.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences for the diagnosis of URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection). 

Firstly, the patient has reported a cough, increased sweating, and a sore throat, which are all common symptoms of URTI. 

Secondly, the patient has described the pain as tedious and located in the occiput, with no radiation to other locations. This is consistent with the location of pain commonly associated with URTI, which is in the head and neck region. 

Thirdly, the patient has reported that the onset of the pain was sudden, which is also consistent with URTI. 

Fourthly, the patient has been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks. This is a risk factor for URTI as it can be easily transmitted through respiratory droplets. 

Overall, the combination of these symptoms and risk factors, along with the patient's history of contact with a person with similar symptoms, strongly suggests a diagnosis of URTI.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences that suggest a diagnosis of URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection).

Firstly, the patient has reported a persistent cough, which is a common symptom of pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, which can cause inflammation and fluid buildup, leading to a persistent cough. 

Secondly, the patient has described the cough as tedious and located in the occiput, with no radiation to other locations. This description is consistent with a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the lining of the lungs (pleura). Pleural effusions can occur as a complication of pneumonia, and can cause chest pain and discomfort. 

Thirdly, the patient has a history of contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks. This suggests that the patient may have been exposed to a respiratory infection, such as pneumonia.

Firstly, the patient reports experiencing a burning pain in the lower chest and posterior chest wall (left side), which is a common symptom of pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, which can cause inflammation and pain in the chest wall. 

Secondly, the patient reports experiencing shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, cough, and a [MASK] sound when exhaling, which are all common symptoms of pneumonia. Pneumonia can cause inflammation and fluid buildup in the air sacs, which can make it difficult to breathe and cause shortness of breath. 

Thirdly, the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a lung disease that can weaken the immune system and make it more difficult to fight off infections. This puts the patient at a higher risk for developing pneumonia. 

Overall, while there may be other possible causes","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a diagnosis of bronchitis:

1. The patient's chief complaint is a burning sensation in the lower chest and posterior chest wall (left side), which is a common symptom of bronchitis.
2. The patient's history of present illness includes multiple respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, and a wheezing sound when exhaling. These symptoms are also common in patients with bronchitis.
3. The patient's past medical history includes a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a type of bronchitis.
4. The patient's physical examination includes multiple respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheezing upon exhalation, which are also common in patients with bronchitis.

Overall, the combination of the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, and physical examination all point towards a diagnosis of bronchitis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of [MASK]. 

Firstly, the patient reports experiencing a burning sensation in the lower [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] wall (left side), which is a common symptom of [MASK]. 

Secondly, the patient reports experiencing multiple respiratory symptoms including [MASK], cough, and [MASK] upon exhalation, which are also common symptoms of [MASK].

1. Symptoms consistent with anemia: The patient reports fatigue, non-restful sleep, shortness of breath, dizziness, and paleness of the skin, which are common symptoms associated with anemia.
2. Pain in the forehead and right temple: While not specific to anemia, this pain could be related to the general symptoms of fatigue and malaise that accompany anemia.
3. History of anemia: The patient has a past medical history of anemia, which increases the likelihood of a current anemic condition.
4. Underweight status: The patient's BMI is less than 18.5, indicating underweight, which can be associated with nutritional deficiencies that may lead to anemia.
5. Physical examination: The patient appears fatigued and pale on examination, which are physical signs that can be indicative of anemia.
6. Medication: The patient is on NOACs, which can sometimes lead to bleeding complications that might result in anemia if there is chronic blood loss.

Further diagnostic testing, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of anemia and determine its type and severity.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences that suggest a diagnosis of anemia. 

Firstly, the patient has a history of anemia, which is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells or hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. 

Secondly, the patient is underweight with a BMI less than 18.5, which is a common finding in patients with anemia. 

Thirdly, the patient reports symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and paleness of the skin, which are all common symptoms of anemia. 

Fourthly, the patient reports being so tired that they are unable to perform usual activities and are bedridden for most of the day, which is also a common finding in patients with anemia.

Firstly, the patient's history of anemia is mentioned in the past medical history section. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells or hemoglobin, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. 

Secondly, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, non-restful sleep, shortness of breath, dizziness, and skin pallor are consistent with anemia. Anemia can cause these symptoms due to the decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 

Thirdly, the patient's BMI of less than 18.5 suggests that they may be underweight, which can increase the risk of anemia. 

Overall, the combination of the patient's history of anemia, symptoms consistent with anemia, and low BMI provide strong evidence for a diagnosis of anemia. Further testing, such as a complete blood count (CBC), would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

Fibromyalgia is often associated with","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is not enough evidence to definitively diagnose any specific condition. The patient's chief complaint of constant fatigue and non-restful sleep is common and could be caused by a variety of factors, including sleep disorders, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors. The patient's history of present illness describes symptoms such as sensitivity, tugging, cramping, and exhaustion in the forehead and right temple, which could be indicative of tension headaches or migraines. However, the patient does not report any radiation of the headache or specify the exact location or onset of the headache, which would be helpful in making a diagnosis.

The patient's past medical history of being underweight and taking new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) could also contribute to their symptoms, but more information would be needed to determine if these factors are related to the patient's current symptoms.

In summary, while the admission note provides some information about the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of any specific condition. Further evaluation and testing would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.","

1. Extreme fatigue and weakness: Common symptoms of anemia due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Dizziness and lightheadedness: Can occur due to decreased hemoglobin and reduced oxygen to the brain.
3. Shortness of breath: Reflects the body's attempt to increase oxygen delivery by breathing more rapidly, a compensatory mechanism in anemia.
4. Pale appearance: Pallor is a classic sign of anemia, indicating reduced hemoglobin and red blood cell count.
5. Poor diet and low BMI: Suggests possible nutritional deficiencies that can lead to anemia, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency.
6. Chronic kidney failure: Can lead to anemia due to decreased production of erythropoietin, a hormone necessary for red blood cell production.

64,38957,"The evidences for the diagnosis of anemia in this patient include:

1. Severe, exhausting pain in multiple locations on her head, which can be a symptom of anemia due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Lightheadedness and dizziness, which are common symptoms of anemia caused by decreased oxygen supply to the brain.
3. Extreme fatigue and the patient being bedridden, which are consistent with the weakness and energy depletion seen in anemic patients.
4. Black stools and light red blood or blood clots in her stool, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to iron-deficiency anemia.
5. Underweight with a BMI less than 18.5, suggesting possible nutritional deficiencies that could contribute to anemia.
6. Pregnancy, which increases the risk of anemia due to higher iron and folate requirements.

Further blood tests would be needed to confirm the diagnosis by checking hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, and other relevant parameters.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences that suggest a possible diagnosis of anemia. 

Firstly, the patient's symptoms of severe, exhausting pain in multiple locations on her head, lightheadedness, dizziness, and excessive tiredness to the point of being bedridden are consistent with the symptoms of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's organs and tissues, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. 

Secondly, the patient's history of poor diet and being underweight with a BMI less than 18.5 are risk factors for anemia. Anemia can be caused by a deficiency of iron, which is essential for the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A diet that is low in iron can lead to anemia, and being underweight can also increase the risk of anemia. 

Thirdly, the patient's recent travel to South East Asia may also be a contributing factor to her anemia. Certain regions in South","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of malaria. 

Firstly, the patient's recent travel history to South East Asia, where malaria is endemic, is a significant risk factor for the disease. Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes. 

Secondly, the patient's symptoms of significant shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, dizziness, and excessive tiredness are consistent with malaria. Malaria can cause respiratory distress and anemia, which can lead to these symptoms. 

Thirdly, the patient's history of poor diet and being underweight with a BMI less than 18.5 is also a risk factor for malaria. Malnutrition can weaken the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off infections like malaria. 

Finally, the patient's recent use of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) may also be a risk factor for malaria. NOACs can increase the risk of bleeding,","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of [MASK].

Finally, the patient's past medical history of poor diet and being underweight with a BMI less than 18.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of significant shortness of breath and difficulty breathing is a classic symptom of PE. PE occurs when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. 

Secondly, the patient's history of present illness (HPI) describes symptoms that are consistent with PE. The patient reports feeling lightheaded, dizzy, and excessively tired, which are all common symptoms of PE. Additionally, the patient reports black stools and light red blood or clots in her stool, which can be a sign of PE. 

Thirdly, the patient's past medical history (PMH) suggests that she may be at increased risk for PE. She has a poor diet and is underweight, both of which are risk factors for PE. Additionally, she is currently pregnant, which can also increase the risk of PE. 

Finally, the patient's physical examination (PE) findings are consistent with PE. The patient appears exhausted and is experiencing difficulty breathing","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of significant shortness of breath and difficulty breathing is a common symptom of PE. PE occurs when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to the lungs, causing difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. 

Secondly, the patient's history of present illness (HPI) describes symptoms that are consistent with PE, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. Additionally, the patient reports feeling lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseous, which are also common symptoms of PE. 

Thirdly, the patient's past medical history (PMH) of being pregnant and having a BMI less than 18.5 puts her at an increased risk for PE. Pregnancy can cause changes in blood flow and hormonal levels, which can increase the risk of blood clots. Additionally, being underweight can also increase the risk of blood clots.

65,24856,"The clinical note provided does not contain sufficient evidence to diagnose sarcoidosis, especially considering the patient's age (2 years old) and the non-specific nature of the symptoms. Sarcoidosis is rare in this age group and typically presents with more specific systemic symptoms and radiographic findings. The symptoms described, such as redness in the eyes, could suggest conjunctivitis, and the swollen or painful lymph nodes could be indicative of an infection or other inflammatory conditions. The loss of consciousness with muscle contractions could suggest seizure activity, which is not typically associated with sarcoidosis. To diagnose sarcoidosis, one would expect to find evidence of non-caseating granulomas on biopsy, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest imaging, and possibly elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, none of which are mentioned in the clinical note. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no evidence to support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of sarcoidosis. 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of diffuse redness in one or both eyes is a common symptom of sarcoidosis.

68,20445,"The evidences for the diagnosis of acute COPD exacerbation/infection in this patient are:

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: The patient's increasing shortness of breath and wheezing, particularly with a history of several flare-ups in the past year, are consistent with symptoms of an acute exacerbation of COPD.

2. **Past Medical History (PMH)**: The patient has a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which predisposes him to exacerbations.

3. **Occupational History**: The patient's work in construction and mining, which are environments with exposure to dust and chemicals, can aggravate COPD and increase the risk of exacerbations.

4. **Physical Examination (PE)**: The patient's appearance of distress and difficulty breathing upon examination supports the presence of an acute respiratory issue, likely related to his underlying COPD.

The combination of the patient's symptoms, history of COPD, occupational exposures, and physical distress are indicative of an acute exacerbation of COPD, and possibly an infection if there are signs of fever or purulent sputum, which would need to be confirmed with further diagnostic tests such as sputum culture, chest imaging, and pulmonary function tests.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences that suggest a diagnosis of Acute COPD exacerbation/infection.

73,36093,"The evidences for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in this patient are:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient's sharp, localized pain that increases with deep breathing and radiates to various locations, along with significant shortness of breath, are consistent with symptoms of PE.

2. **History of DVT**: The patient has a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis, which is a known risk factor for PE as clots can dislodge and travel to the lungs.

3. **Recent Surgery**: Surgery within the last month is a risk factor for PE due to potential immobility and hypercoagulability postoperatively.

4. **Prolonged Immobility**: The patient has been immobile for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks, which increases the risk of clot formation.

5. **Travel History**: Long-distance travel, such as flying to North America, is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including PE.

These factors combined with the clinical presentation suggest a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism, warranting immediate diagnostic testing.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of pain that increases when breathing in deeply is a common symptom of PE. PE occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing and chest pain. 

Secondly, the patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and immobility for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks increase the risk of developing a PE. DVT is a blood clot that forms in the deep veins of the legs, and it can travel to the lungs and cause a PE. Immobility can also increase the risk of developing a DVT, which can then lead to a PE. 

Thirdly, the patient's history of surgery within the last month and travel to North America in the last 4 weeks also increase the risk of developing a PE. Surgery can disrupt blood flow and increase the risk of developing a DVT, which can then lead to a PE.

Firstly, the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sensitivity to deep breathing are consistent with pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, which can cause inflammation and fluid buildup, leading to difficulty breathing and chest pain. 

Secondly, the patient's history of immobility for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks and recent travel to North America are both risk factors for pneumonia. Immobility can weaken the immune system and make it more difficult for the body to fight off infections, while travel to areas with different climates and environments can expose individuals to new bacteria and viruses that they may not be immune to. 

Finally, the patient's recent history of undergoing surgery within the last month may also be a contributing factor to the development of pneumonia. Surgery can weaken the immune system and make it more difficult for the body to fight off infections.

76,6177,"The evidences for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema from the clinical note include:

1. History of fluid in the lungs (past medical history of similar condition).
2. Shortness of breath (a common symptom of pulmonary edema).
3. Swelling in the ankles and calves (indicative of fluid retention).
4. Pain that is worse when lying down and alleviated by sitting up (orthopnea, a symptom associated with heart failure and pulmonary edema).
5. Generalized fatigue and discomfort (non-specific symptoms that can be associated with poor oxygenation and fluid overload).
6. History of heart failure, high blood pressure, and heart attack or angina (risk factors for the development of acute pulmonary edema).","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema (APE). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of pain in various parts of the body, including the chest, breast, and posterior chest wall, is consistent with the symptoms of APE. APE is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can cause chest pain and discomfort. 

Secondly, the patient's history of present illness, which includes symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling in the ankles and calves, and generalized fatigue and discomfort, are also consistent with the symptoms of APE. Fluid accumulation in the lungs can cause shortness of breath, and swelling in the ankles and calves can be a sign of fluid retention. 

Thirdly, the patient's past medical history of fluid in the lungs, dialysis, high blood pressure, heart attack or angina, and heart failure are all risk factors for the development of APE. 

Finally, the patient's physical examination findings of visible swelling in the ankles and calves","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema:

1. Shortness of breath: Acute pulmonary edema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can lead to difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. The patient's report of shortness of breath is consistent with this symptom.
2. Swelling in the lower extremities: Fluid accumulation in the lungs can also cause fluid to accumulate in the lower extremities, leading to swelling in the ankles, feet, and calves. The patient's report of visible swelling in the calves is consistent with this symptom.
3. Generalized fatigue: Acute pulmonary edema can cause fatigue due to the increased workload on the heart and lungs. The patient's report of generalized fatigue is consistent with this symptom.
4. Worsening of symptoms with lying down: Acute pulmonary edema can cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs when the patient lies down, leading to difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. The patient's report that symptoms are worse when lying down","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is no clear evidence for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema. Acute pulmonary edema is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. The symptoms described in the admission note, such as tedious, sensitive, and tugging pain in various parts of the body, swelling in the ankles and calves, and generalized fatigue and discomfort, are not specific to acute pulmonary edema and could be caused by a variety of conditions.

Furthermore, the patient's past medical history of dialysis, high blood pressure, heart attack or [MASK], and [MASK] does not provide any evidence for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema. Dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure, high blood pressure is a condition in which the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries is consistently too high, heart attack is a medical condition in which blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, and [MASK] is not a specific medical condition.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the admission note, there","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema (APE):

1. Symptoms: The patient is experiencing a variety of symptoms that are consistent with APE, including tedious, sensitive, and tugging chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue.
2. Physical examination: The patient appears to be in respiratory distress and there is visible fluid accumulation in the chest and calves.
3. History of present illness (HPI): The patient's HPI describes a variety of symptoms that are consistent with APE, including chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, and fluid accumulation in the chest and calves.
4. Past medical history (PMH): The patient has a history of high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for APE.
5. Medications and allergies: The patient's current medications and allergies are not provided in the information given, but it is important to note that certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can increase the risk of APE.

Overall","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences for the diagnosis of [MASK]. 

Firstly, the patient is experiencing a variety of symptoms including [MASK] in the [MASK], [MASK], and [MASK] [MASK] wall, which is consistent with the definition of [MASK].

77,46885,"The evidences for the diagnosis of a pulmonary neoplasm in this patient include:

1. Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
2. Persistent cough
3. Shortness of breath
4. Loss of appetite
5. Involuntary weight loss
6. History of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke
7. Family history of lung cancer

These clinical features, combined with the patient's risk factors, raise the suspicion of a lung malignancy, warranting further diagnostic imaging and evaluation by an oncologist.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary neoplasm (i.e., lung cancer). 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of coughing up blood is a classic symptom of lung cancer. Hemoptysis, or the coughing up of blood or blood clots, is a common symptom of many types of lung cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 

Secondly, the patient's history of shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and involuntary weight loss over the last 3 months are also common symptoms of lung cancer. These symptoms can be caused by the growth of a tumor in the lung, which can obstruct the airway and make it difficult to breathe. 

Thirdly, the patient's history of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and exposure to secondhand smoke can also increase the risk of developing the disease. 

Finally, the patient's family history of lung cancer is another potential","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer.

Thirdly, the patient has a family history of lung cancer, which is another risk factor for the disease. 

Fourthly, the patient has been experiencing shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and involuntary weight loss, which are all common symptoms of lung cancer. 

Finally, the patient is a current smoker and a former smoker, and is exposed to secondhand smoke daily, which are both known risk factors for lung cancer. 

Overall, the combination of these symptoms, risk factors, and medical history suggest that the patient may have lung cancer","Based on the provided admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. 

Firstly, the patient has been coughing up blood, which is a common symptom of lung cancer. Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, can be caused by a variety of conditions, including lung cancer.

Finally, the patient has been experiencing persistent cough, loss of appetite, and weight loss, which are also common symptoms of lung cancer. 

Overall, while there may be other possible causes for the patient's symptoms, the combination of hemoptysis, smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, family history of lung cancer, and persistent cough, loss of appetite, and weight loss suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. Further testing, such as a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of coughing up blood is a classic symptom of lung cancer. Lung cancer can cause bleeding in the airways, which can manifest as coughing up blood. 

Secondly, the patient's history of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke is a significant risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and exposure to secondhand smoke can also increase the risk of developing the disease. 

Thirdly, the patient's persistent cough and involuntary weight loss over the last 3 months are also symptoms of lung cancer. Lung cancer can cause a persistent cough and weight loss due to difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. 

Finally, the patient's age of 76 and the fact that they have a history of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke are additional risk factors for lung cancer. Lung cancer is more common in older adults and those with a history of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. 

Overall, based on the information provided in the admission note, there","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. 

Firstly, the patient has been coughing up blood, which is a common symptom of lung cancer. This symptom is particularly concerning given the patient's history of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, which are known risk factors for lung cancer. 

Secondly, the patient has been experiencing a persistent cough for the past 3 months, which is another common symptom of lung cancer. 

Thirdly, the patient has a history of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, which are well-established risk factors for lung cancer.

Further diagnostic tests, such as blood work, imaging studies, and a thorough physical examination, would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to rule out any serious conditions. It is important for the patient to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment in order to manage their symptoms and improve their overall health.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there is not enough evidence to definitively diagnose any specific condition. The patient's chief complaint and history of present illness describe symptoms that could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, and psychiatric disorders. The patient's past medical history of depression and anxiety, as well as their use of medication in the past, could also be relevant to their current symptoms. However, without a physical examination or additional diagnostic tests, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms. It is important for the patient to receive a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of their symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of abdominal pain. 

Firstly, the patient has been experiencing significant abdominal pain in various areas including the flank, iliac fossa, hypochondrium, and belly. This pain is described as cramp-like and is not radiating to any other location, which is consistent with the symptoms of abdominal pain. 

Secondly, the patient reports feeling like they are nauseous, vomiting, feeling like they are dying, feeling detached from their own body or surroundings, and feeling like they are about to pass out. These symptoms are also consistent with the symptoms of abdominal pain. 

Thirdly, the patient has a history of previous abdominal pain and has been diagnosed with abdominal pain in the past. This suggests that the patient may have a pre-existing condition that could be contributing to their current symptoms. 

Finally, the patient has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks, which suggests that their symptoms may not be related to a recent trip or exposure to a new environment.

However, some symptoms reported by the patient, such as widespread pain, increased sweating, fatigue, chills, and cough, can be associated with influenza. The absence of a fever is not mentioned, which is a common symptom of influenza. The presence of a rash is not typical for influenza and suggests a possible alternative or concurrent diagnosis. Further diagnostic testing, such as a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT), would be necessary to confirm influenza.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several evidences for the diagnosis of Influenza. 

Firstly, the patient is experiencing widespread pain, increased sweating, fatigue, chills, and a cough, which are all common symptoms of Influenza. 

Secondly, the patient has a rash on the back of the neck, which is pink in color, larger than 1cm, and causes intense pain and severe itching. The rash does not peel off or swell, which is consistent with the rash associated with Influenza. 

Thirdly, the patient is a smoker and is immunosuppressed, which puts her at a higher risk of developing severe complications from Influenza.

3. **Past Medical History**: The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a personal history of heart attack or angina.
4. **Family History**: There is a family history of early cardiovascular disease, which increases the patient's risk for angina.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient is a smoker, which is a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease.

These clinical features support the suspicion of stable angina, warranting further cardiovascular evaluation.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of stable angina. 

Firstly, the patient reports symptoms that increase with physical exertion but are alleviated with rest, which is a classic symptom of angina. Angina is a type of chest pain that occurs when blood flow to the heart is restricted, often due to the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. 

Secondly, the patient reports pain in various locations including the left side of the chest, upper chest, both breasts, and the epigastric region, which are all common sites for anginal pain. Additionally, the pain radiates to the right bicep, thyroid cartilage, thoracic spine, under the jaw, and right shoulder, which are also common sites for anginal radiation. 

Thirdly, the patient reports constant fatigue and non-restful sleep, which are also common symptoms of angina. Fatigue can occur due to the reduced oxygen supply to the muscles during physical activity, while non-restful sleep can be caused by the discomfort and anxiety associated with anginal symptoms.

94,23904,"The evidences for the diagnosis of unstable angina from the clinical note include:

1. Worsening chest pain over the last 2 weeks with less effort required to cause symptoms, indicating increasing frequency and severity, which is characteristic of unstable angina.
2. Pain description as heavy and exhausting, typical of anginal discomfort.
3. Pain location in the chest and radiation to areas like the jaw and shoulders, which is consistent with the referral pattern of cardiac pain.
4. A history of heart disease (previous heart attack or angina), which increases the risk of subsequent cardiac events.
5. Risk factors such as significant overweight, high cholesterol, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking, all of which contribute to coronary artery disease and unstable angina.
6. The patient's current use of cholesterol medication suggests a known issue with lipid management, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease.

These clinical features and history align with the presentation of unstable angina, necessitating urgent cardiac evaluation.","Based on the information provided in the admission note, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest a possible diagnosis of unstable angina. 

Firstly, the patient's chief complaint of feeling nauseous and having a feeling of vomiting could be a symptom of unstable angina. Angina is a type of chest pain that occurs when the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. This can cause a feeling of discomfort, nausea, and even vomiting.

Secondly, the patient's history of progressively worsening symptoms over the last 2 weeks, with less effort required to cause the symptoms, is consistent with the development of unstable angina. Unstable angina is characterized by episodes of chest pain that occur at rest or with minimal exertion, and the symptoms tend to worsen over time.
